# A simple counter App 

A simple counter that uses riverpod, and allows the user to modify the theme of the app.

## Getting Started

- To run this project you need to have [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) installed. Since this app is intended to be used in a mobile device i suggest to have an emulator (IOS / ANDROID) to test it, however it can be run as a web app. A tutorial to create an android emulator using android studio can be found at https://youtu.be/GhuiNcOEv1A.
- Once installed run ```flutter pub get``` to install dependencies. 
- In [VSCODE](https://code.visualstudio.com) you can select a device to test the project using CTRL + SHIFT + P, then on the main.dart file press F5.
